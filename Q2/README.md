**Occurrences_within_50km.R** is used to create a file of all locations of origin of *S. hermonthica* tested for relative emergence, along with number of specimens from natural history collections identified on a particular host species within a radius of 50 km.

**GLMM_Occurrences.R** tests for association between occurrences and relative emergence on a particular host.  Includes the code to recreate Fig. X d-f.
