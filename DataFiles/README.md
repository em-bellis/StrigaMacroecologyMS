## Original data files from herbarium collections
1. Kew_Digivol_Striga_hermonthica.csv: specimens from Kew collection  

2. Striga_hermonthica_Collections_P_etal_Germinal.csv: specimens from French herbaria  

## Data derived from published experiments
1. SI.dat.1.30.20.csv: relative emergence of *S. hermonthica* observed from published experiments. 'Emergence' on each host genotype (listed in 'host.gen' column) is relative to the maximum emergence observed for that *S. hermonthica* population on any host genotype. 'ENM_a_s50km', 'ENM_a_m50km',	and 'ENM_a_z50km' are the average value for ENM contrasts within 50 km of location of origin of *S. hermonthica* population. ENM contrasts refer to the difference in habitat suitability between the all-occurrence model (a) and models built using only occurrences on sorghum (s), millet (m), or maize (z).

2. SI.dat.3.31.20.csv: same as 'SI.dat.1.30.20.csv' except average of ENM contrasts is given for variable distances from location of origin of *S. hermonthica* populations. Distance in meters is given in 'radius' column.

3. SI.dat.4.2.20.csv: same as 'SI.dat.3.31.20.csv' except standard deviation of ENM contrast value for pixels within a given distance of *S. hermonthica* populations is given rather than the mean value.  

4. Occurrence_8.13.20.csv: number of occurrences from herbarium collections on each host within 50 km oflocation of origin of *S. hermonthica* populations from experiments.
