# StrigaMacroecologyMS
This repository contains R code necessary to recreate analyses and figures presented in Bellis, McGlaughlin, dePamphilis, & Lasky (submitted). *Macroecology of host specialization in a parasitic plant*. The manuscript addresses three research questions:

Q1. Does regional abundance of a host crop lead to local specialization by parasites?  

Q2. Is host specialization associated with patterns of parasite occurrence on different hosts?  

Q3. Do abiotic environmental gradients shape the distribution of specialist and generalist parasites, suggesting that future dynamics of specialization vs. generalization may be predicted by abiotic change?  

This repository is organized so that scripts needed to recreate analyses to answer each question are present in the corresponding directory ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3'). Data files used to answer more than one question are located in the 'DataFiles' directory. Files and scripts for the supplemental material are in the 'Supplement' directory.
