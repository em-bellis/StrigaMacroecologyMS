Scripts to recreate Figs. 4 and 5 are included.

Run part **Fig4EF_Productivity.R** to create lower parts of Fig. 4 first. Then run **Fig4.R** to create parts A-D and generate composite figure.

**LMM_ENMcontrasts.R** tests for association between ENM contrasts and relative emergence. Includes the code to recreate Fig. 3 g-i.

**future_ENMs.R** runs analyses to compare difference in habitat suitability for future projections compared to ENMs based on present.
